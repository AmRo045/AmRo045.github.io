I recently made the switch from Windows 11 to [Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/), a user-friendly Linux distribution
based on Ubuntu. It’s been an interesting journey adapting to a new system, and I’ve discovered some clear pros and cons
from my experience so far.

## Pros

- **Free and open-source** – No licensing fees, product keys, or activation issues.
- **Smooth gaming performance** – I was able to play `Dota 2` and `Stronghold: Warlords` with only a slight FPS drop
  using Proton via Steam.
- **Windows-like experience** – The interface feels familiar, easing the learning curve for new Linux users.
- **Software availability** – Most essential apps have Linux alternatives.

## Cons

- **Annoying input-switch popups during games** – This interrupts gameplay and can be frustrating.
- **No Linux version of my gaming mouse software** – Thankfully, my mouse remembers its settings
- **Tedious multi-user setup** – Configurations don’t always apply system-wide, so each user needs to repeat setup
  steps.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I am getting used to it. Zorin OS feels smooth and easy to use for someone coming from Windows.
It has some small problems, but the freedom and speed make it a good choice for me.
